# Layout
* Mix between the following templates:
  * [WhiteSpace.com](www.whitespace.com)
  * [Mediaqueri: Incredible Types, page 3](http://incredibletypes.com/)
* Attached three Google fonts to my project's fonts folder (turned out I won't be using because I can't figure out how to 'src' them in my sass)
* I'll be using web standard fonts for now
