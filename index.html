        <p>Meet Sam. A glimpse into childhood past. There, in his eyes is the future. Not a care in the world which is how it should be at his age. The story of a boy is told in the face, where a smile is truly worth a thousand other smiles. And that hat, fitting for the chap. Remember, all of us were his age once. Sometimes, we should have a 'not a care in the world' moment too, to get away from all that adultness.</p>
